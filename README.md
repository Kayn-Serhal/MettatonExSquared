# MettatonSquared v0.0.1

The goal? Try to make a prototype of a brand new fighting system for RPGs!

For that, i will first try to remade the Undertale combat system using SDL.

Then, it will be Deltarune...

And from that, i will try to implement mine.

Mettaton EX will be the dummy enemy that i will use for this demo.


I mean...
You can't have too much Mettaton, and this is going to take a while...
